### Status

## Installation

Download and extract the ZIP file into the `.FreeCAD/Mod` folder or use git to clone into `.FreeCAD/Mod`

### Dependencies

FreeCAD-Trails depends on the [pivy_trackers 2D geometry library] https://github.com/joelgraff/pivy_trackers to run.  This library provides low-level 2D rendering support through Python for FreeCAD.

FreeCAD-Trails currently depends on the following projects, included as submodules in this repository:

* [FreeCAD_python_support (release branch] (https://github.com/joelgraff/freecad_python_support/tree/release)

IDE's which support git should update the submodules without issue.  However, the user is encouraged to refer to the [github submodule documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for furtrher assistance, as extra steps may be required to update the submodule paths in the project.
